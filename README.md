# tourney-bot
 Bot that does the tourney

# usage
1. Create a file named `tokenSucks.py`, and the code for it should look similar to this:
```py
 def tokenSucks():
    return("asdfasdfASD:KFJASPDIFASODFhasodfhpasdd") # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN
def imgbbSucks():
    return("123412340912837afd") # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR IMGBB API TOKEN - get one at https://api.imgbb.com/ (not an ad)
```
2. When you run main.py, it'll say there are some modules uninstalled - install those modules (note: I'm not listing the modules here because more may be added and I don't want to update this section cuz making tutorials is boring)
3. Run `main.py`

# change-log
Past changes:
| Version | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **v0.1**    | Using the diagrams module - [it looked pretty bad](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/837114010301759489/1080250025688449074/bracket.png) |
| **v0.2**    | Transitioned to using PIL - looks a lot better with much more flexibility |
| v0.2.1  | Added a lot of misc. Battles 2 command pulling from the NinjaKiwi API |
| v0.2.2  | Updated `README.md` to have a tutorial and changelog - marks beginning of well-documented era |
| v0.2.2.1 | Updated `/info` to reflect battles 2 commands and slightly updated /user and /leaderboard to respond to the interaction at the cost of public error messages |
| v0.2.2.2 | Updated Battles 2 related commands to default to season 11 |
| v0.2.3 | Introducing: SSAMBO! B2T bot will now create a webhook and give SSAMBO's thanks whenever he's wished a happy birthday. B2T bot will now also respond to every :hi: message with his own hi. 24/7 uptime soon:tm:. This also marks the beginning of date-recording era --- 9 March 2023 |
| v0.2.3.1 | Made it so no message will ping anyone unless specifically told to (no, nobody abused it for the short time it *did* exist) --- 9 March 2023 |


Future changes:
| Version | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **v0.3**  | Made bot online 24/7 (or almost that, anyways)
| v0.3.1  | Added better looking buttons to the `/leaderboard` command - possibly made faster |
| v0.3.2  | More NinjaKiwi API Commands |
| v0.3.2  | Make large (16+ player) tourneys split into two |
| **v0.4** | Small tourney creation feature, allowing someone to create a tourney and for people to register for that tourney in one channel |
| v0.4.1 | Bug fixes and improvements (I know it's gonna happen) |
| `v1.0` | Can create tournaments! From start to finish, buttons everywhere, pretty much the challonge tourney bot but better and not p2w |
| **v1.1** | Added way to contribute funds for tourneys (tentative) |
| `v2.0` | Fully automated - creates tournaments automatically every week, automatically using contributing funds, and (hopefully) won't need any further interaction |
| v2.0.1 | Bug fixes and improvements |

End of forseen development
