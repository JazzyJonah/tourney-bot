# tourney-bot
 Bot that does the tourney

# usage
1. Create a file named `tokenSucks.py`, and the code for it should look similar to this:
```py
 def tokenSucks():
    return("asdfasdfASD:KFJASPDIFASODFhasodfhpasdd") # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN
def imgbbSucks():
    return("123412340912837afd") # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR IMGBB API TOKEN - get one at https://api.imgbb.com/ (not an ad)
```
2. When you run main.py, it'll say there are some modules uninstalled - install those modules (note: I'm not listing the modules here because more may be added and I don't want to update this section cuz making tutorials is boring)
3. Run `main.py`
